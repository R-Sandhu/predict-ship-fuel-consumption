Predict the fuel consumption of ships for voyages to help ships operate at most efficient level.
================================================================================================

Objective:
----------
The objective of this project is to create a performance model of a large commercial gas container ship, to predict the rate of fuel consumption on a set of features.

Data:
-----
The data used in this experiment are collected from the ship's sensors and from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) realted to weather and sea state. 

Structure: 
----------
The project's folder structure follows [cookie-cutter](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) style. The root folder contains the following subfolders and files.

- data: This folder contains raw, interim and processed datasets used in this project, in csv format.


- models: Contains trained candidate model saved as a pickle file.


- notebooks: This folder contains 4 jupyter notebooks featuring data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature generation and model building.


- reports: Jupyter notebook as a final report with a detailed end to end analysis.


- src: Contains scripts to train the Extra Trees ensemble model for scoring on new data.


- requirement: A text file with libraries used in this project and their versions.
